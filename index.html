                  <h3 class="Name">Virat Kohli</h3>
                  <p>
                    Born and raised in Delhi, Kohli represented the city's cricket team at various age-group levels before making his
                    first-class debut in 2006. He captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, 
                    and a few months later, made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played
                    as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and 
                    was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup.

                  <h3 class="Name">AB de Villiers</h3>
                  <p>
                    He began his international career as a wicket-keeper/batsman (returning to the role for a few years in mid-career),
                    but has played most often solely as a batsman. He would bat at various positions in the batting order but predomin
                    antly in the middle-order. Noted as one of the most innovative batsmen in the modern game, de Villiers is noted 
                    for many unorthodox shots behind the wicket-keeper and slips.

                  <h3 class="Name">Quinton de Kocky</h3>
                  <p>
                    He is widely regarded as one of the best wicket-keeper batsmen in the world and has drawn comparisons with former 
                    Australian great Adam Gilchrist. An opening batsman and wicket-keeper, de Kock made his domestic debut for the 
                    Highveld Lions during the 2012/2013 season.

                  <p>
                    In November 2016 he was named in New Zealand's Test squad for the tour against Pakistan and debuted in the first
                    Test match on 17 November.[2] He took his maiden Test wicket by dismissing Azhar Ali. In the match, Grandhomme 
                    scored a fifty in the match and took a five-wicket haul in his maiden innings of Test match cricket.[3] 
                    He won the Man of the Match award in his first test match and became fourth New Zealand player to do so.
